As I tend to do from time to time, I have rewritten this site recently in technologies that currently interest me and pruned all old content. It's now written in Rust. You can read more about the rewrite on the [Tech stack](/tech-stack) page.

My main open source project these days is [@hyper-views/framework](https://github.com/hyper-views/framework). You can read more about it on the [Hyper Views Framework](/hyper-views-framework) page.

Hyper Views is the github organization I created to move some of my projects that I think have broader usefulness and appeal out from under my personal user account. Essentially I realized people would probably be more inclined to use @erickmerchant/framework if it was under a more neutral scope.

I've set [Dedupe.css](https://github.com/hyper-views/dedupe.css), another Hyper Views project, aside at the moment, though it is still one of my main open source projects. I think there are some really good ideas there, but unfortunately I look at the current code as more of a proof of concept rather than a finished project. I'd probably want to rewrite it in Rust honestly, because I'm obsessed with Rust now, but don't want to jump right into that because that is an absolutely massive undertaking.

I'm also working on [Minefield](https://affectionate-leakey-9e4135.netlify.app/field/8/8/10), a version of minesweeper. It is the only current thing I'm writing that uses Hyper Views Framework. I want to add a high scores board, and try to get some traffic to it.
