As I tend to do from time to time, I have rewritten this site recently in technologies that currently interest me and pruned all old content. It's now written in Rust. You can read more about the rewrite on the [Tech stack](/tech-stack) page.

My main open source project these days is [@hyper-views/framework](https://github.com/hyper-views/framework). You can read more about it on the [Hyper Views](/hyper-views) page.

I'm also working on [Minefield](https://affectionate-leakey-9e4135.netlify.app/field/8/8/10), a version of minesweeper. It is the only current thing I'm writing that uses Hyper Views. I want to add a high scores board, and try to get some traffic to it.
