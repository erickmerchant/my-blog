WorkStep is an employee listening platform where companies can hear from their workforce. It is highly customized per company, but often allows upper management to better understand what is going wrong at facilities and regions. The application is Python and React, and the bulk of the work I did used both, and involved making charts, tables, and the forms where feedback was gathered. During my tenure here I established conventions for more maintainable CSS. I also improved build times by adopting SWC and doing other improvements which directly saved the company money and developers' sanity. I also was instrumental in adopting front-end testing, and wrote many of the initial tests, which then allowed us to migrate to TypeScript. We had a lot of junior devs and I did a lot of pair programming with them.

At Brightspot I developed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client websites, as well as worked with Java since their CMS is written in Java. They use web components, so I learned a lot about web components and have used them ever since. I often would help junior developers who mostly just knew Java with the the front-ends of their sites. One of my focuses here was improving accessibility on several sites. We would get an audit and I'd fix all the problems it outlined. I worked on some really big sites here: [Sotheby's](https://www.sothebys.com/en/), [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/), [Special Olympics](https://www.specialolympics.org/), and some small Amazon sites, etc.

The bulk of my experience was at Adpearance, so it's hard to summarize exactly what I did here. When I started I was one of only three engineers. When I left it was a company with several engineering teams, two product, one maintenance, and one project focused, and I was a part of all of that growth. When I started I did a lot of LAMP stack work. My skills with PHP were expert level. We used ExpressionEngine as a CMS mostly and I built countless sites in it, writing plugins, developing templates, etc. I drove the adoption of Composer for dependency management, and really elevated the PHP usage. Later I took on more of a front-end JavaScript sort of role, since I was the only person that wanted to write JS, and I had a lot of skill in that as well. I was tasked with creating the admin for our proprietary Java (Spring Boot) CMS we were developing. Together with one other engineer we built the CMS in about four months and it was a success allowing Adpearance to break into new markets. I worked extensively with Node.js, Vue, and browserify. During my time here I drove the adoption of git. It was actually very difficult to get the company to adopt version control (git), which seems unbelievable now. During my time there I also wrote web-scrapers, and countless build tools, dashboards, and internal tools.

Where my career started. NetBiz was a digital services company that mostly placed people on Google and other search engines. A lot of that changed over the years, but I worked on the websites that were mostly given away to customers when they signed on for other services.

So I wrote a lot of PHP, but I also had a focus on JQuery and CSS. I worked on internal dashboards as well, and worked on their proprietary CMS. I was tasked with building the company's site, which was probably the biggest honor, because it meant they had a lot of confidence in my front-end skills.
