I am currently looking for a full-time role as either a front-end engineer, design engineer, or full-stack engineer. I would love if that role involved Rust, JavaScript, CSS, Typescript, Vue, Web Components, REST, or similar technologies. I love the web, but also more broadly just programming, and solving difficult problems with computers.
