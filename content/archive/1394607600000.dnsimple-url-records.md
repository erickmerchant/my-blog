title: 'DNSimple URL Records'
summary: "If you're using DNSimple along with an ALIAS record, don't forget to add a URL record for www"
---
I recently started using DNSimple and Github Pages. I set up an ALIAS record with DNSimple for erickmerchant.com that points to erickmerchant.github.io. As GitHub Pages documentation puts it&hellip;

> Some DNS providers (like DNSimple) allow you to use an ALIAS record to point your custom apex domain to username.github.io. If your DNS provider supports this, it will allow us to provide the full benefits of our Content Delivery Network to your Page.

The content delivery part of that is great and illustrated by the fact that if you check the DNS of your domain on a site like [What's My DNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) you'll see that your site is truly distributed. ![My DNS Propagation](/uploads/thumbnails/whatsmydns.jpg)

The GitHub docs don't mention this, but you probably should set up a URL record for the www subdomain of your site. [Here's how to do that.](http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/url-record/)
