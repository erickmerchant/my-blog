I'm 47 today. My birthday has always felt like a super common one. I have two
relatives who share it: an uncle and a cousin — both named David. Then at a
previous job I had two coworkers at one point with the same birthday — both
designers. One of them I worked with briefly, but the other was there for a long
time like me and we still wish each other happy birthday. So today I started
wondering, is November 15th actually that common of a birthday, or have I just
known a lot of people?

Well according to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday#Distribution_through_the_year)
— but also many random sites — July, August, and September are the peak of birth
frequency at least in the US, but, I don't know, it's not an enormous difference
in my opinion. New Years day and Christmas are significantly less common days
though. It seems like that's probably artificial due to planned c-sections.
Regardless November 15th is not in that three month peak. So not actually
abnormally common.

I was suppose to be born in October, being a whole month late. They don't really
let that happen anymore, and it's good that they don't. I nearly died and had to
be rushed to a larger hospital in the "big" city of Syracuse. It could be hard
for people in actual big cities to imagine, but the small city, Cortland NY,
where I'm from has one hospital that sometimes is just like "_nah_ we can't
handle that", and sends you to a different hospital 30 minutes away. This still
happens. I'm actually from an even smaller place called Lincklaen which is 30
minutes away from Cortland and has no hospital. It's not Alaska or even the
Adirondacks, but it is remote in a lot of ways, and in the same state as NY city
of all places.

Ok so what's up with having two relatives with the same birthday and two
coworkers. Well it turns out there is this math problem called the
[Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) which answers
this question. Or rather the solution to it can find "...the probability that,
in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share the same
birthday.", to quote Wikipedia.

You can expand it to look at three people too, and according to
[this calculator at Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=birthday+problem+calculator&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22BirthdayProblem%22%2C+%22n%22%7D+-%3E%2288%22&assumption=%22FSelect%22+-%3E+%7B%7B%22BirthdayProblem%22%7D%2C+%22dflt%22%7D)
you need 88 people for the probability to go above 0.5 or 50%.

So yeah having 3 people in a family, even a very large family, with the same
birthday is not that likely but not like lottery numbers rare. At a small
digital marketing agency it's a bit more unlikely, but still not a sign that
November 15th is some sort of super birthday. So I guess I've just known a lot
of people. At 47 that's bound to happen.
