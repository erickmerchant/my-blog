It's November 15th, my birthday today. I'm 47. My birthday has always felt like
a super common birthday. I have two relatives with the same birthday: an uncle
David who is now deceased, and a cousin David. Then at a job years ago I had two
coworkers at one point with the same birthday. One of them I worked with
briefly, but the other was there for a long time like me and we still wish each
other happy birthday. Is November 15th actually that common, or have I just
known a lot of people?

Well according to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday#Distribution_through_the_year)
— but also many random sites — July, August, and September are the peak of birth
frequency at least in the US, but I don't know, it's not an enormous difference
in my opinion. New Years day and Christmas are significantly less common days
though. It seems like that's probably artificial due to planned c-sections.
Regardless November 15th is not in that three month peak. So not actually
abnormally common.

I was suppose to be born in October, being a whole month late. They don't really
let that happen anymore, and it's good that they don't. I nearly died and had to
be rushed to a larger hospital in the big city of Syracuse. It's hard for people
in major cities to imagine but the small city hospital I'm from sometimes is
just like "nah we can't handle that" and sends you to a different hospital 30
minutes away. This still happens. I'm actually from an even smaller place called
Lincklean which is 30 minutes away from the small city and has no hospital.

Ok so what's up with having two relatives with the same birthday and two
coworkers. Well it turns out there is this math problem called the
[Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) which answers
this question. Or rather the solution to it can find "...the probability that,
in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share the same
birthday.", to quote Wikipedia.

You can expand it to look at three people too, and according to
[this calculator at Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=birthday+problem+calculator&assumption=%7B%22F%22,+%22BirthdayProblem%22,+%22n%22%7D+-%3E%2279%22&assumption=%22FSelect%22+-%3E+%7B%7B%22BirthdayProblem%22%7D,+%22dflt%22%7D)
you need 79 people for the probability to go above 0.5 or 50%.

So yeah having 3 people in a family, even a very large family, with the same
birthday is not that likely but not like lottery numbers rare. At a small
digital marketing agency it's a bit more unlikely, but still not a sign that
November 15th is some sort of super birthday.
