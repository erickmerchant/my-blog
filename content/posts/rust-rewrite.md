## Why Rust

Recently I rebuilt this site to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on the server side, because I'm really into Rust now. There are a lot of great things about Rust — safety, expressiveness, versatility, etc. — that others can explain better than me, but I started learning it in 2020, because I initially wanted to use WebAssembly, so Rust was a natural choice. I ended up not doing too much with Web Assembly, but by 2021 I was having a lot of fun with Rust. I loved programming in it.

## Actix

To build this current iteration of the site, I compared as many web frameworks as I could find, and ultimately chose [Actix](https://actix.rs/). Apart from its middleware which is a little beyond my current understanding, Actix's API is discoverable and easy to learn. The best place to look for help has been their examples repo. They also have a Discord.

## Cargo dependencies

Some of the more important Cargo dependencies that I'm using, besides Actix:

### [Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama)

For Jinja-like templates. The only downside to Askama for me is that changing a template means recompiling the project, but it's a tradeoff. The advantage is that I never wonder whether I'm using something undefined in my templates.

### [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

For compiling JavaScript. It's basically a Rust Babel. It does aim to be many other things as well, but I'm just using it to compile some JavaScript. It's great.

### [Parcel CSS](https://parceljs.org/blog/parcel-css/)

For compiling CSS. It's basically like Postcss in Rust. It was actually released when I had most of the server written already. Originally I was using a Sass implementation in Rust, but I had forgotten how sometimes Sass syntax conflicts with vanilla CSS, so I welcomed Parcel's arrival. It allows me to do nesting and forget about prefixes. The only downside here is its alpha, so it sometimes breaks. Committing my lock file has been a life saver.

## More to come

Any how there is more I could write about this rewrite, and I will certainly be writing more about Rust in the future.
