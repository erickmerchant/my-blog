I have been meaning to write this since before 2025, but maybe I was just trying to get too much out, and if I can keep it brief I can finally write this. 2024 sucked a lot. I feel like Job, being tested by a petty god.

I was laid off from my job of two and half years. I really did like working there and I have nothing ill to say. No clue why they let me go. I've been looking for work since. I have had a lot of interviews. Gone the full round with a few. Nothing has landed yet. I try to keep going, but honestly I don't have much hope I'll ever be a profressional software engineer again. And I think I'm actually damn good at it.

We had a mouse in I think September. It came out when we were putting my daughter to sleep every night which was the biggest problem, but it generally appeared randomly at all hours. Spent a small fortune I don't have on getting rid of it. I learned a few things. First you have to find where it's getting in and seal it up. Trust me, it is very very likely not living in your house. Second mouse traps don't work. Don't even bother with those. It's been months since we've seen it or it's droppings, but I'm still leery to go in the kitchen at night. I have a phobia of rodents, which may be better or worse now.

My dog started to get sick the day of the presidential election. She didn't eat her breakfast which for my food-driven hound was unheard of. She had had colon cancer in 2022 or 2023 and had surgery. It returned. Her decline was rapid and the hardest thing I've ever dealt with. My borther committed murder/suicide when I was 16, but this was probably worse. She was my baby. Her name was Ellie, a bluetick coonhound, we adopted in 2019. She was beautiful which people would comment on all the time. Smart, she picked up on things very quickly, and had this habit of getting us to do what she wanted before we even realized it. And funny. She was the first one to make my daughter laugh, and she was seriously just a hilarious dog. She'll be missed and honestly I'm not sure if I'll ever get over it. Just wasn't fair at all. Fuck cancer. The one good thing is that it prompted me to get my slightly overdue colonoscopy and they found some precancerous polyps. She may have saved my life.

I lost a wisdom tooth, too just to close out the year. Since then the world has turned to chaos, and 2025 isn't likely to be better. I'm broke. But I have my health. And my family.

Soon I'll devote five days a week to taking care of my daughter which will save a lot of money. I'm looking forward to it. She's in part-time daycare now, and Tuesdays and Thursdays when she's home it's like I have a job. It's hard, but important. It may be that I just try to return to work after she's in school, but I'll certainly still apply to something every week at least. In the meantime I'll work on open source and try to write and get paid for that.
