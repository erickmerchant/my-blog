I have been meaning to write this since before 2025, but maybe I was just trying to get too much out, and if I can keep it brief I can finally write this. 2024 was terrible.

I was laid off from my job of two and half years. I really did like working there and I have nothing ill to say. No clue why they let me go. I've been looking for work since. I have had a ton of interviews. Gone the full round with a few. Nothing has landed yet. I try to keep going, but honestly I don't have much hope I'll ever be a professional software engineer again. And I think I'm actually damn good at it. It will always be my passion and hobby at least though. I am an web developer. Not having a job can't change that.

We had a mouse in I think September. It came out when we were putting my daughter to sleep every night, just as everything was quiet and she was about to be put in her crib, which was the biggest problem, but it generally appeared randomly at all hours. I learned a few things. First, you have to find where it's getting in and seal it up. This is what a pest control person told me and I didn't believe it but now I know it to be true: it is very, very likely not living in your house. Unless you hear scratching sounds then it is and you have a major problem. Second, mouse traps don't work. Don't even bother with those. I still have them around in random dark corners, but I expect they'll just sit there forever unused. It's been months since we've seen it or its droppings, but I'm still leery to go in the kitchen at night. I have a phobia of rodents, which is kind of better now to be perfectly honest.

My dog, Ellie, started to get sick the day after of the presidential election, and passed away a few weeks later. She didn't eat her breakfast which was unheard of. Ellie loved food. Was insane for food, so this was a sign that something was very, very wrong. She had had colon cancer in 2023 and had had surgery. It returned. Her decline was rapid and the hardest thing I've ever dealt with. My brother committed suicide, and I've had a shoulder replacement, so it says a lot that I place this way up there. She was our baby before we had a baby, and she'll always be in my heart. A little bit about Ellie... she was a bluetick coonhound we adopted in 2019. She was beautiful, which people would comment on all the time. Smart, she picked up on things very quickly, and had this habit of getting us to do what she wanted before we even realized it. And funny, she was the first one to make my daughter laugh, and she was seriously just a hilarious dog. ... I'm not sure if I'll ever get over it. Just wasn't fair at all. Fuck cancer. The one good thing is that it prompted me to get my slightly overdue colonoscopy and they found some pre-cancerous polyps. She may have saved my life.

I lost a wisdom tooth too, just to close out the year. Since then the world has turned to chaos, and 2025 isn't likely to be better. I'm broke. But I have my health. And my family. Soon I'll devote five days a week to taking care of my daughter which will save money. I'm looking forward to it. She's in part-time daycare now, and Tuesdays and Thursdays when she's home it's like I have a job. It's difficult, but important. It may be that I'll finally work again after she's in school, but I'll certainly still apply to something every week at least. And if I get a job, we have a grandmother ready to take over. In the meantime I'll work on open-source and try to write and get paid for that.
