I got laid off from my most recent role of senior software engineer in early March. I have been putting this blog on some applications, cover letters, and profiles, so I thought I should have something here about why you should hire me as your senior fullstack or front-end engineer. So here you go: three reasons you should hire me.

First of all I love what I do. Ever since I took my first course in Visual Basic in college I've loved programming. Little did I know when I was trying to just take a few classes on design and got steered into the web design curriculum, which was a mix of design and programming, that I'd find my true calling in life. I love programming so much that it's my main hobby. It currently involves a few open-source projects that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/erickmerchant). I've been doing a lot with web components, but I would happily use React or Vue at my next role. Also I have been using Rust primarily for server development, but I would be happy to use Node.js or Java or whatever.

Second, I have been doing this a long time. I have basically seen it all I think, and at this point there is not much that can come up that I do not at least know where to look for a solution. That experience was earned by working on a large variety of projects and products, sites and applications, at agencies and at start-ups.

Third, I am easy to work with. I communicate well with other engineers, designers, and product folks. There is really only so much one person can do. Great web sites or products are built by teams. I want to be part of a great team. On the other hand, if needed I can also work without a lot structure as well, and am happy to architect and implement solutions to problems independently.
