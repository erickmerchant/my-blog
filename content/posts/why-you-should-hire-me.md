I got laid off from my most recent role of senior software engineer in early March. I have been putting this blog on some applications, cover letters, and profiles, so I thought I should have something here about why you should hire me as your senior fullstack or front-end engineer. So here you go: three reasons you should hire me.

First of all, I love what I do. Ever since I took my first course in Visual Basic in college I've loved programming. Little did I know when I was trying to just take a few classes on design and got steered into the web design curriculum, which was a mix of design and programming, that I'd find my true calling in life. I love programming so much that it's my main hobby. It currently involves a few open-source projects that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/erickmerchant).

Second, I have a lot of experience. My experience was earned by working on a large variety of projects and products, sites and applications, at agencies and at start-ups.

Third, I am great to work with. I love to collaborate with design and product, help other engineers out, and in general just like to help my team/organization succeed. Great projects and products are built by great teams, and I have been a part of some really great teams over the years.

Take a look at my [résumé](https://resume.erickmerchant.com/) if you haven't already, and find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erick-merchant-346296117/).
