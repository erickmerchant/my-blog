<h2>Family</h2>

<p>I am about to be a father for the first time. My daughter is due in June. There are a million things I need to do still, but I am feeling mostly ready. We still do not have a name, but we have a list of possible names. Installing the car seat was easy, but I should get it checked just to be sure I did it correctly.</p>

<h2>Watching, Listening, Reading</h2>

<p>I was watching <a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/star-trek-picard/">Picard</a>, and now I am watching Strange New Worlds. I want to watch all the new trek, but have limited time, and have to choose. I loved most of Picard. Strange New Worlds seems like it should be mostly episodic, which I prefer and I am loving the retro feel of everything. I am only one episode in though.</p>

<p>Listening to SoundCloud. One of My Morning Jacket's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/my-morning-jacket/sets/my-morning-jacket-my-morning">newer album</a> on repeat mostly. Also Lord Huron. I deleted Spotify, so I am very much still just finding stuff I remember.</p>

<p>As far as reading goes when I am not reading a baby book, I am trying to get through the newish <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/LKO/last-king-of-osten-ard#author0">The Last King of Osten Ard</a> trilogy by Tad Williams, but embarrassingly have not picked it up in months. It is good, but I just am terrible at reading these days for various reasons.</p>

<h2>More to come</h2>

<p>That's it for now. I want to write one of these every season. It will get me writing more at the very least.</p>
