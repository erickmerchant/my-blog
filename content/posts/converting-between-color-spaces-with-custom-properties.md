This is about writing a function to convert between color spaces in the browser.

Last year I wrote ["Getting a CSS property's value in any units"](/posts/getting-a-css-property-value-in-any-units/), a trick you can do to get a CSS property in any units. The post never mentions it but I probably should have specified that it's for properties that are a length. Recently I found another cool trick that again involves defining a custom property, but this time with colors. Again I got nerd-sniped by something posted in the Shoptalk Show Discord.

So you can look at his CodePen and my [fork](https://codepen.io/erickmerchant/pen/JoPgGQY). What I came up with uses a custom property, so we are working with a color, and then the `color` function to coerce the value to a new color space â€” in this case rgb. Then I do some regex and map stuff to take the value and turn it into a hex code that the color input uses.

What might be interesting though is if we had a function like `getPropertyValueInUnits` from my previous post to convert any color to a new color space. Let's call it `convertColor`. What might be
