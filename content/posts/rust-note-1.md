In the future there should be more of these notes, but this is the first. It's just a thing I have learned about Rust in the past 2 years of using it.

Run [Clippy](https://crates.io/crates/clippy) against your Rust code to lint it for common mistakes and improve your code. It's a great way to learn new things about the language too.

I once wrote code like this...

``` rs
let mut minifier_options = stylesheet::MinifyOptions::default();

minifier_options.targets = targets;
```

Clippy emitted a warning, "field assignment outside of initializer for an instance created with Default::default()" and recommended I use [struct update syntax](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#creating-instances-from-other-instances-with-struct-update-syntax) instead. So I changed the code to...

``` rs
let minifier_options = stylesheet::MinifyOptions {
	targets,
	..stylesheet::MinifyOptions::default()
};
```

The great thing is that I did not even know about struct update syntax and now I do.
