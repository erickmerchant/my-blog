<p>Voting yesterday involved two AAA trucks and me running across a very busy road like frogger in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Around noon my wife and I filled out our ballots, signing and dating each other's envelope. Where we live you have to do that. What you are suppose to do if you live alone I don't know.</p>

<p>I got the baby in the car seat, adjusting it quickly because once again she's grown taller. That's a good thing, but I never am quick enough and she starts crying while adjusting. Luckily once she's being carried in the seat she's always happy.</p>

<p>We hopped in our 2019 Rogue Hybrid which we got earlier this year. I pressed the button to start it, and instead of it starting it made this series of weird pumping or whirring sounds. A series of symbols flashed on the screen where the speedometer is, and a message, "Malfunction, see owner's manual".</p>

<p>So we reluctantly went back, ballots still in hand. Louise had a giant diaper event, and my wife had to go back to work, so some time passed doing normal paternity leave duties.</p>

<p>I called AAA. They came out and were able to jump start it. But then the technician tested the battery and it was at 93%. So it was a big mystery as to why it wouldn't start to begin with.</p>

<p>So there are some questions, but yay, the car runs and we can go drop off our ballots. Except it didn't and we couldn't. Again we all get bundled up to go, go to start the car and same thing â€” symbols, message, weird sounds.</p>

<p>At this point I called the dealership, and I called AAA again with the expectation that it needs to just be towed. I could have gotten it jumped again and possibly drove it, but it was making me nervous. Meanwhile we had not voted yet. It was 6 and I make the decision that it was time I just head out on foot alone.</p>

<p>The closest drop off was at this school. It is really close actually. About a mile, but it is on the other side of this road that might as well be a highway. There are a lot of vehicles on it always, and they do not stop at the few crosswalks that exist. Where I live people regularly run stop signs, crash into fences, and jump curbs. Crazy aggressive driving stuff happens. Plus it was dark at this point.</p>

<p>I was nervous as I approached the road. Headlights blinded me, and unfortunately I can't really see very far in one direction. I hadn't noticed before but there is actually a very low hill, but high enough that you can't see what is coming very far. Also unfortunately the sidewalk ends going up the hill. So I just had to wait for what looked like a break and run. The speed limit is 30 but people go as fast as they possibly can on this road. If I haven't convinced you already this was very, very dangerous.</p>

<p>I made it across. I found the drop box inside. It's a nice school. I hadn't been in a school in 26 years and it brings back memories. Then it was back across the hell road.</p>

<p>I got home just in time for the tow truck to arrive. Then I ate my cold dinner, and I started seriously thinking about the fact that I'd like to live in a place where I could walk to vote safely. I go to sleep deeply later that night. Exhausted, but having voted.</p>

<p>And by the way today I learned that it was just the battery. The 93% was just wrong.</p>
