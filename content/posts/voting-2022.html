<p>Voting yesterday involved two AAA trucks and me running across a very busy road with literally no breaks in traffic frogger style in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Around noon my wife and I filled out our ballots, signing and dating each other's envelope. Where we live you have to do that. What you are suppose to do if you live alone I don't know.</p>

<p>I got the baby in the car seat, adjusting it quickly because once again she's grown taller. That's a good thing, but I never am quick enough and she starts crying while adjusting. Luckily once she's being carried in the seat she's always happy.</p>

<p>We hopped in our 2019 Rogue Hybrid which we got earlier this year. I pressed the button to start it, and instead of it starting it made this series of weird pumping or whirring sounds. A series of symbols flashed on the screen where the speedometer is, and a message, "Malfunction, see owner's manual".</p>

<p>So we reluctantly went back, ballots still in hand. Louise had a giant diaper event, and my wife had to go back to work, so some time passed doing normal paternity leave / dad stuff.</p>

<p>I called AAA, then they came out and were able to jump start it. But then the technician tested the battery and it was at 93%. So it was a big mystery as to why it wouldn't start to begin with.</p>

<p>So the technician leaves. There are some questions, but yay, the car runs and we can go drop off our ballots. Except it didn't and we couldn't. Again we all get bundled up to go, go to start the car and same thing. Symbols, message, weird sounds.</p>

<p>At this point I call the dealership, and I call AAA again with the expectation that it needs to just be towed. I could get it jumped again and possibly drive it, but it's making me nervous. Meanwhile we have not voted yet. It's 6 and I make the decision that it's time I just head out on foot alone.</p>

<p>The closest drop off was at this school. It's really close really. About a mile, but it is on the other side of this road that might as well be a highway. There are a lot of vehicles on it always, and they do not stop at the few crosswalks that exist. Where I live people regularly run stop signs and crash into fences and jump curbs. Crazy aggressive driving stuff happens. Plus it's dark at this point.</p>

<p>I'm nervous as I approach the road. Headlights blinding me, and unfortunately I can't really see very far in one direction. I hadn't noticed before but there is actually a very low hill, but high enough that you can't see what is coming very far. Also unfortunately the sidewalk ends going up the hill. So I just had to wait for what looked like a break and run. The speed limit is 30 but people go as fast as they possibly can on this road. If I haven't convinced you already this is the <strong>road to hell</strong>.</p>

<p>I make it across. I find the drop box inside. It's a nice school. I hadn't been in a school in 26 years and it brings back memories. Then it's back across the hell road. At this point the foxes are out. One cool thing about where I live is there are lots of foxes and this is the hour when the screaming begins. I hear one screaming its head off as I leave the hell road behind me. I never actually see it though.</p>

<p>I get home just in time for the tow truck to arrive. Then I eat me cold dinner, and I start seriously thinking about the fact that I'd like to live in a place where I could walk to vote. I go to sleep hard later that night. Exhausted, but having voted.</p>

<p>And by the way today I learned that it was just the battery. The 93% was just wrong or it was from getting boosted.</p>
