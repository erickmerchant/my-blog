Last year I wrote ["Getting a CSS property's value in any units"](/posts/getting-a-css-property-value-in-any-units/), a trick you can do to get a CSS property in any units. The post never mentions it, but I probably should have specified that it's for properties that are a length. Recently I found another cool trick that again involves defining a custom property, but this time with colors. Again I got nerd-sniped by something posted in the Shoptalk Show Discord.

So you can look at his CodePen and my [fork](https://codepen.io/erickmerchant/pen/JoPgGQY). What I came up with uses a custom property, so we are working with a color, and then the `color` function to coerce the value to a new color space — in this case rgb. Then I do some regex and map stuff to take the value and turn it into a hex code that the color input uses.

Let me highlight the relevant bits of js.

```js
import {LitElement, css} from "https://esm.sh/lit";

export class ColorInput extends LitElement {
	static {
		// This is important so that the value that we later set is cast to an actual color and not just stored as a string.
		window.CSS.registerProperty({
			name: "--color-input-value",
			syntax: "<color>",
			inherits: false,
			initialValue: "#000000",
		});
	}

	createRenderRoot() {
		return this;
	}

	connectedCallback() {
		super.connectedCallback();

		const label = this.querySelector("label");
		const colorInput = this.querySelector("input");
		const textInput = document.createElement("input");

		label.insertAdjacentElement("afterend", textInput);

		colorInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
			textInput.value = colorInput.value;
		});

		textInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
			// This takes a string that is the input's value, and uses the color function in css to say take this value and convert it into srgb.
			textInput.style.setProperty(
				"--color-input-value",
				`color(from ${textInput.value} srgb r g b)`
			);

			const style = window.getComputedStyle(textInput);
			const value = style.getPropertyValue("--color-input-value");

			// Now we have an rgb color. But it's not a hex and color inputs use hex, so now we have to grab the first three numbers out of that with a regex match — only three because color inputs don't support opacity — and use that to produce a hex value.
			const numbers = value.match(/[0-9\.]+/g);

			colorInput.value = `#${numbers
				.slice(0, 3)
				.map((n) =>
					Math.floor(Number(n) * 255)
						.toString(16)
						.padStart(2, "0")
				)
				.join("")}`;
		});
	}
}
customElements.define("color-input", ColorInput);
```

- We register a custom property `--color-input-value` with `window.CSS.registerProperty`. This is important so that the value that we later set is cast to an actual color and not just stored as a string.
- Then when the input changes we set the custom property on an element. I used the input, but it doesn't matter where really. We set it to `color(from ${textInput.value} srgb r g b)`. This takes a string that is the input's value, and uses the `color` function in css to say take this value and convert it into srgb.
- Now we have an rgb color. But it's not a hex and color inputs use hex, so now we have to grab the first three numbers out of that with a regex match — only three because color inputs don't support opacity — and use that to produce a hex value. I did not test this cross browser and I suspect that if there is anywhere it might fail even in browsers that support custom properties, it might be this step. I could imagine a browser stringifying an rgb as a hex instead of the `rgb` functional notation. Why wouldn't they? Hex values are older than that notation.

Custom properties, and the newish `color` function are really powerful, and when you use css and js together you can do cool things.
