For a long time etags were the beginning and end of cache headers that I would set when writing a server. It's sibling, `cache-control`, sort of eluded me. I knew about using it with cache busting techniques, but I never did it. Recently it finally dawned on me how to combine `etag` with `cache-control` headers and cache busting.

The strategy is fairly simple. I can't be the first person to do this, but I have never heard it explained as the following.

- Use an `etag` header for `text/html` responses
- Use a `cache-control` header with a `max-age=31536000` (one year which is the recommended max) set for everything else that has a cache busting url like your js and css.

This way in an ideal situation, with a warm cache, the browser just requests the html and receives a `304` status code. Everything else gets served from the cache and is a `200`.
