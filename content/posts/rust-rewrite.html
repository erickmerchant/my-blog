<p>Recently I rebuilt this site to use <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> on the server side. There are a lot of great things about Rust — safety, expressiveness, versatility, etc. — that others can explain better than me, but I started learning it in 2020, because I initially wanted to use WebAssembly, so Rust was a natural choice. By 2021 I started to feel comfortable doing certain things, and I was having a lot of fun with Rust. I loved programming in it.</p>

<h2>Actix</h2>

<p>To build this current iteration of the site, I compared as many frameworks as I could find, and ultimately chose <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix</a>. Apart from its middleware which is a little beyond my current understanding, Actix's API is discoverable and easy to learn. The best place to look for help has been their examples repo. They also have a Discord.</p>

<h2>Cargo dependencies</h2>

<p>Some of the more important Cargo dependencies that I am using, besides Actix:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/djc/askama">Askama</a></dt>
  <dd>For Jinja-like templates. The only downside to Askama for me is that changing a template means recompiling the project, but it is a tradeoff.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://swc.rs/">SWC</a></dt>
  <dd>For compiling JavaScript. It is basically a Rust Babel. It does aim to be many other things as well, but I am just using it to compile some JavaScript.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://parceljs.org/blog/parcel-css/">Parcel CSS</a></dt>
  <dd>For compiling CSS. It is basically like Postcss in Rust. It was actually released when I had most of the server written already. Originally I was using a Sass implementation in Rust, but I had forgotten how sometimes Sass syntax conflicts with vanilla CSS, so I welcomed Parcel's arrival. It allows me to do nesting and forget about prefixes. The only downside here is its alpha, so it sometimes breaks. Committing my lock file has been a life saver.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>More to come</h2>

<p>Any how there is more I could write about this rewrite, and I will certainly be writing more about Rust in the future.</p>
