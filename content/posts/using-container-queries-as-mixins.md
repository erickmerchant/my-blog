[Mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin/) are a thing that's kind of missing from CSS. I found an interest way to get mixin type functionality from container queries. To be clear this is a total hack, but it could be useful.

## An example

### The HTML

```html
<div>
	<p>red</p>
</div>
<div class="large-blue">
	<p>blue</p>
</div>
```

### The CSS

```css
p {
	color: red;
}

.large-blue {
	container: blue large / inline-size;
}

* {
	@container blue (min-width: 0) {
		color: blue;
	}

	@container large (min-width: 0) {
		font-weight: bold;
		font-size: 2em;
	}
}
```

So the major limitation is that since it is a container query you can't target the parent. Notice that there are divs wrapping paragraphs. [Style Queries](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/style-queries) would allow this for real, but that also has the same limitation.
