"Small disclaimer that this is barely a history at all. It's more of a story needing more investigation.\n\nThe first place I saw tagged template literals used to do declarative UI was with [hyperx](https://github.com/choojs/hyperx). It does seem like that is the first case too. Hyperx gave rise to or was used in other projects: [bel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bel), etc. Now there is also [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/), [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm), and others that all seem to be unrelated.\n\n# First commits\n\n- hyperx Jan 2, 2016\n- lit-html  Jun 29, 2017\n- HTM Jun 21, 2018\n\nThe reason this is interesting to me is that I use tagged template literals to create virtual DOM in [@erickmerchant/framework](https://github.com/erickmerchant/framework). I got the idea from hyperx. I used hyperx for a long time, then wrote a [hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript) type implementation and then finally a hyperx like implementation. Along the way I've seen the others appear and was excited that this idea of using template literals for html was becoming more popular. However it was never clear what influenced what or what the timeline is. It does seem like an obvious enough idea that they could all be independent of each other, but in some case it does seem like there was inspiration.\n"
