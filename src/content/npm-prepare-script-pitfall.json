"Today I learned that if you run `npm publish` with sudo and have a prepare script that runs babel, that script will fail to actually run.\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"@erickmerchant/example\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"An example\",\n  \"main\": \"dist/main.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    *\"prepare\"*: *\"babel --presets es2015 main.js -d dist/\"*\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"babel-cli\": \"^6.10.1\",\n    \"babel-preset-es2015\": \"^6.9.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor instance trying to `sudo npm publish` a package with the above package.json you'd get the error \"npm WARN lifecycle @erickmerchant/example@1.0.0~prepare: cannot run in wd %s %s (wd=%s) @erickmerchant/example@1.0.0 npm run build /Users/erickmerchant/Code/example\".\n\nYour package will publish correctly, essentially publishing a broken version. In my case it just published the last code that was actually transpiled with `npm run prepare`. You should never `npm publish` with sudo. You should also never really need to use sudo with npm.\n\n# Some links\n\n- [About scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)\n- [Highly recommended package to make publishing easier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/np)\n- [A useful video about fixing npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions)\n"
